# Module 12 Challenge - Bellybutton Biodiversity

In this module we were asked to create an interactive website that would allow Roza's volunteers to see the results of their navel cultures. The website includes five main sections. 

The first two sections can be found in the upper left corned of the page under the header. The top of the two sections asks each user to use the drop down and locate their specific test subject id. This selection will cause the exhibits to update for the specific user. The section under this includes the demographic information about the user as provided in the volunteer survey. 

To the right of the left most section is a horizontal bar chart. This chart looks as each individual's OTU types with the highest total counts based on the culture submitted. This section limits the types to the top 10. For additional information regarding each bar, hover the mouse over the specific bar and view the pop out. Note that the colors of the bars correspond to the OTU types in a similar method as in the buble charts that are explained below. 

To the far right, the volunteer can view the guage to review the frequency they wash their navel per week based on the information they submitted in the survey.

Finally, the bottom of the page contains The bubble chart that displays the count and variety of bacteria found in a volunteer's navel culture. The x-axis represents the OTU number (note that the OTU number has no numerical significance) while the y-axis shows the total count for each OTU bacteria type. The size, or radius, of each point is based on the OTU type's percetnage of total bacteria found. As discussed above, each points color is based on their OTU type number and corresponds to the colors in the bar chart. 

In order to provide additional customization, a couple of formatting changes were made. The color scheme in the charts was edited to be more consitant throughout the page, a background of gray and white text was added for a softer feel, and a bacteria themed image was added to the background of the jumbotron header. Last, but not least, information buttons were added throughout the page to assist volunteers with each section. These buttons can be found as white "i" icon's.
